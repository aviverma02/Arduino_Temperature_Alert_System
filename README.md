# Arduino_Temperature_Alert_System
This project demonstrates how to interface an analog temperature sensor (TMP36 / LM35) with an Arduino Uno to build a temperature-based alert system. The Arduino continuously reads the sensor’s analog output, converts it into a temperature value in Celsius, and compares it with a predefined threshold (default: 30°C).
